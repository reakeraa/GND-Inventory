1) Cherwell asset CMDB - accuracy concern - accuracy defined across the systems sectioon below.
*Serial numbers versus Asset tagging today

      # Cherwell Asset Status - Status - Justin Dowling - TDC definition of tags 7-191-22
# Allocated – (operational spares)  This status is only used by TDC for Enterprise-wide projects, so you should not see this status used for Network Devices Break Fix
# Domiciled stocking locations managed by AA
# Non Domiciled stocking locations held and managed by Decision One
# Hold – (set aside for projects) This is true, though I would expand this to put your Operational Spares in this status and we just put “Operational Spares” in          the Location Specifics field so they can be sorted
# Installed - (deployed) Production Status
# Lost – This is a quarterly activity that should be reconciled with TDC’s and 3PL’s
# Salvaged – physically destoyed
# Stock - (Excess) available for others to consume outside network or inside network – highest priority use first. R. Perez approval.  Production Spare – no              defined use operationally or for a project and can be used to conserve cash versus purchasing – Do not use for reimbursable projects – Align with network              engineering before use is preferred.

      # Priority One
D1 Inventory located in Cherwell Location with correct naming convetnions - Spare Break Fix etc...- See TDC - Spreadhseet Comapre

      # Inventory Avialble for Delivery Product
Full Audit of TDC's = DFW/PHX/PHL/CLT/LHR ?  other criticla to ITFS break fix - Where Spares located

2) Automation portal updates 
3) Cherwell master install decommm 

    # Aruba
Identify Aruba Spares locations - (7/15/2022) (justin) deliverable - year one purchase - spares - (124 original count)

THIS IS A TEST EXAMPLE

D1 locations and pull back - Cisco valid Inventory - H3C EOSL

# Decision One Weekly Task List
* Process Current and Improvements
* Replacement switches go back to Buckingham Fort Worth unless otherwise discuss during the call with AA tech and D1 tech
* Will discuss in future meetings
* Right now we have confirmed when a switch is replaced it can go back to our TDC
* Sara - Discuss further with OPS
* Roger - Aruba – Discuss more about how this process will work
* D1 can work with Aruba (WWT) to get a replacement added back to stock when one needs replaced (more to come) 
* Equipment needed with D1 is dispatched
* Have OPS add equipment need just to double sure they get what is needed (sample ticket)
* Network sites and LAN weekly reports
* Review and Questions
* Discuss any other topics for all.
